       _C_o_n_s_u_l_t_r  reads  a rule set produced by c4.5rules and uses
       this to classify items whose description  is  provided  by
       the  user.   The  rule  set  read is _f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m_._r_u_l_e_s_, where
       _f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m is the file  name  stem  (see  manual  entry  for
       c4.5).

       Consultr  prompts  for  the  value  of  an  attribute when
       needed.  Unknown attribute values are specified as '?'.

       If the attribute has discrete values,  its  value  can  be
       specified either as
        _v
       where v is one of the permissible values of the attribute,
       or as
        _v_1_:_p_1_, _v_2_:_p_2_, _._._. _, _v_n_:_p_n
       where the vi's are some or all of the  permissible  values
       of the attribute and the pi's are corresponding probabili­
       ties.  If the sum of the pi's is less than 1, the  remain­
       ing  probability is distributed equally among the unspeci­
       fied values of the attribute.  For example, if attribute A
       has possible values X, Y and Z, the reply
        X:0.5
       is the same as
        X:0.5, Y:0.25, Z:0.25

       If  the attribute has real values, its value can be speci­
       fied either as
        _r
       where r is a real number, or as
        _r_1 _- _r_2
       where r1 and r2 are real  numbers.   The  latter  form  is
       taken to mean "somewhere in the interval [r1,r2]".

       When  all  relevant  attributes have been determined, con­
       sultr will give a class that the  item  might  belong  to.
       The  likelihood  of the class may be indicated by a proba­
       bility.  For example,
        _C_1  _C_F _= _0_._9
       means "class C1 with probability 0.9".

       At the end of each item, consultr will prompt for  retrial
       of  the  same  item,  a new item, or end of session.  When
       retrying  an  item,  the  previous   values   of   queried
       attributes are displayed in square brackets.  If the value
       is unchanged, reply with  a  carriage  return;  otherwise,
       specify the changed value.

       Options and their meanings are:


       --ff_f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m  Specify the filename stem (default DDFF))

       --tt          Display  the rule set at the start of the con­
                   sulting session.
