       _C_4_._5_r_u_l_e_s  reads  the  decision  tree or trees produced by
       C4.5 and generates a set of  production  rules  from  each
       tree  and  from  all  trees  together.  All files read and
       written  by  C4.5  are  of  the  form  _f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m_._e_x_t  where
       _f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m is a file name stem that identifies the induction
       task and _e_x_t is an extension  that  defines  the  type  of
       file.   The  Rules  program  expects  to find a nnaammeess ffiillee
       defining class, attribute and  attribute  value  names,  a
       ddaattaa  ffiillee  containing  a  set  of objects whose class and
       value of each attribute is specified, a uunnpprruunneedd ffiillee gen­
       erated by C4.5 from the ddaattaa ffiillee,, and (optionally) a tteesstt
       ffiillee containing unseen objects.

       For each tree that it finds, the program generates  a  set
       of  pruned rules, and then sifts this set in an attempt to
       find the most useful subset of them.   If  more  than  one
       tree  was  found,  all  subsets  are  then  merged and the
       resulting composite set of  rules  is  then  sifted.   The
       final  set  of rules is saved in a machine-readable format
       in a rruulleess file.  Each of the rulesets  produced  is  then
       evaluated  on  the original training data and (optionally)
       on the test data.

       --ff_f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m  Specify the filename stem (default DDFF))..

       --uu          Evaluate rulesets  on  unseen  cases  in  file
                   _f_i_l_e_s_t_e_m_._t_e_s_t_.

       --vv_v_e_r_b      Set the verbosity level [0-3] (default 0).

       --FF_s_i_g_l_e_v_e_l  Invoke Fisher's significance test when pruning
                   rules.  If a rule contains a  condition  whose
                   probability  of  being  irrelevant  is greater
                   than the stated level, the rule is pruned fur­
                   ther (default: no significance testing).

       --cc_c_f        Set  the  confidence level used in forming the
                   pessimistic estimate of a  rule's  error  rate
                   (default 25%).

       --rr_r_e_d_u_n_d_a_n_c_y
                   If many irrelevant or redundant attributes are
                   included, estimate the ratio of attributes  to
                   ``sensible'' attributes (default 1).
